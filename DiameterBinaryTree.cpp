543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


  class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int diameter=0;
        height(root, diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
private:
    int height(TreeNode* root,int& diameter){
        if(!root) return 0;

        int lh=height(root->left,diameter);
        int rh=height(root->right,diameter);
        diameter=max(diameter, lh+rh);
        return 1+max(lh,rh);
    }
};
